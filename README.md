# YouTube-UI-Clone
## Project Description
This project is a custom recreation of the YouTube interface built using HTML and CSS. The aim was to replicate the core structure and layout of YouTube's main page, including the header, search bar, sidebar menu, and video grid layout. The design focuses on responsiveness, clean code structure, and the use of web fonts for a visually appealing interface.

#Key Features
Responsive Header: Contains a menu icon, YouTube logo, search bar, and notification section, providing a similar look and feel to the original YouTube interface.
Interactive Sidebar: A menu with icons for navigation that mimics YouTubeâ€™s sidebar, allowing quick access to sections like Home, Explore, Subscriptions, and Library.
Video Grid Layout: Displays video previews in a grid, complete with thumbnails, video titles, channels, view counts, and timestamps.
Font Integration: Uses Google Fonts for a modern aesthetic that matches YouTube's overall styling.
Icons and Styling: Incorporates SVG icons for a clean, sharp look, with CSS custom styling for each element to ensure visual consistency and quality.
Purpose
The project served as a hands-on exercise to deepen my understanding of CSS layout techniques, including Flexbox for structuring content and CSS Grid for managing the video preview layout. It also explores responsive design and user interface organization, closely studying YouTube's UI to replicate its features and improve my front-end development skills.
